# a. Compute mean of a series grouped by another series:

import pandas as pd

# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'sales_training_df'
# Group by 'Category' and compute the mean of 'Sales'
mean_sales_by_category = sales_training_df.groupby('Category')['Sales'].mean()
print("Mean Sales by Category:")
print(mean_sales_by_category)

# b. Fill an intermittent time series to replace all missing dates with values of the previous non-missing date:
# Assuming you have a time series DataFrame named 'weather_forecast_df'
# Fill missing values with the previous non-missing date's value
weather_forecast_df['Temperature'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

# c. Perform appropriate year-month string to dates conversion:
# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'sales_training_df' with a column 'YearMonth' as a string
sales_training_df['YearMonth'] = pd.to_datetime(sales_training_df['YearMonth'], format='%Y-%m')

# d. Split a dataset to group by two columns and then sort the aggregated results within the groups:
# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'sales_training_df'
# Group by 'Region' and 'Product', then calculate the sum of 'Sales' and sort the results
grouped_and_sorted = sales_training_df.groupby(['Region', 'Product'])['Sales'].sum().sort_values()
print("Grouped and Sorted Sales:")
print(grouped_and_sorted)

# e. Split a given dataframe into groups with bin counts:
# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'sales_training_df' and you want to create bins for the 'Sales' column
bins = [0, 100, 200, 300, 400]
labels = ['Bin1', 'Bin2', 'Bin3', 'Bin4']

# Create a new column 'SalesBin' based on binning
sales_training_df['SalesBin'] = pd.cut(sales_training_df['Sales'], bins=bins, labels=labels)

# Group by the newly created 'SalesBin' column
grouped_by_bins = sales_training_df.groupby('SalesBin')
print("Grouped by Sales Bins:")
for bin_label, group in grouped_by_bins:
    print(f"Bin: {bin_label}")
    print(group)
    print()
